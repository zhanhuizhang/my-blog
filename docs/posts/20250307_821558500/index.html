From STAT’s Helen Branswell: There have been concerns that production and delivery of next winter’s flu shots might be delayed, given the unexplained cancellation of a meeting of the FDA’s vaccines advisory committee, which had initially been scheduled for mid-March. The FDA said Friday it will make its recommendations to manufacturers after consulting with federal partners, adding: “We do not anticipate any impact on vaccine supply or timing of availability.” Erstwhile synthetic biology darling Ginkgo Bioworks is showing further signs of decline: It’s subleasing large portions of its Seaport headquarters in Boston as part of a broader cost-cutting effort.</p>
