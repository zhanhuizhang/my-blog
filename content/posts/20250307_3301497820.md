Novo Nordisk said yesterday that it will start selling its obesity drug Wegovy directly to patients at a reduced price, following a similar move from Eli Lilly, though Novo’s offering is broader. The company’s chief scientific officer, Jay Bradner, said at a health care conference yesterday that it will study three doses of “low, medium, and high.” He disclosed little about the exact dosing scheme that will be tested, but said that “you can think of a titration scheme as starting lower.” Recall that late last year, Amgen reported that in a Phase 2 trial, MariTide led to roughly 20% weight loss over a year.
