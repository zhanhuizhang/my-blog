Under the terms of the agreement, Candid will acquire global rights to a tri-specific antibody developed on WuXi Biologics’ WuXiBody™ platform. This antibody, in the preclinical development stage, targets three different antigen sites: BCMA, CD20, and CD19. These targets are carefully chosen to enhance the killing effect on tumor cells via T-cell-mediated immune responses. BCMA (B-cell maturation antigen), highly expressed in multiple myeloma (MM) and other hematologic malignancies, is a key target for treating these diseases. As a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, BCMA is primarily expressed on the surface of malignant and normal plasma cells and is not expressed in essential tissues, making it an ideal treatment target. CAR-T cell therapies targeting BCMA have shown significant efficacy in relapsed or refractory MM patients, with overall response rates from 73% to 100% and complete response rates from 31% to 69%.\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align:center;\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:black;\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://synapse-static.patsnap.com/strapi-static/image_3f491634ab.png\" alt=\"figure 2\">\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align:center;\">\u003Cspan style=\"background-color:white;color:#333333;\">\u003Cspan lang=\"EN-US\" dir=\"ltr\">BCMA signaling pathway\u003Csup>1\u003C/sup>\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cspan lang=\"EN-US\" dir=\"ltr\">On the other hand, CD20 and CD19 are antigens broadly and relatively stably expressed on the surface of B cells, playing crucial roles in various B-cell-related cancers like non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). CD19 is an antigen that remains expressed throughout the B-cell development process and is also highly conserved in most B-cell malignancies. At the same time, CD20 is a marker of mature B cells, used as a target in the treatment of B-cell lymphomas and leukemias.\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cspan lang=\"EN-US\" dir=\"ltr\">The uniqueness of WuXi Biologics’ tri-specific antibody lies in its ability to bind simultaneously to two different antigens on tumor cells (like CD20 and CD19) and an activation molecule on the surface of T cells (such as BCMA or possibly another co-stimulatory molecule). This multi-binding approach helps to direct T cells close to tumor cells and promote close contact between them, thereby enhancing T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Additionally, this tri-targeting could inhibit tumor cells' ability to evade immune surveillance, further increasing the effectiveness of the treatment. Notably, the WuXiBody™ platform's unique advantage is its ability to construct multi-specific antibodies of various valences to meet the biological needs of different projects, thus providing greater flexibility and potential for drug development.\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cspan lang=\"EN-US\" dir=\"ltr\">The financial terms involved in this collaboration are also notable.

CM313 is an innovative therapeutic agent that targets the CD38 molecule, a glycoprotein highly expressed on the surface of various hematologic tumor cells. As a potential \"best-in-class\" candidate, CM313 uniquely binds to the CD38 molecule to not only eradicate antibody-secreting cells, including long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs), thereby preventing antibody-mediated platelet destruction but also restoring normal platelet production and function. Furthermore, CM313 has the ability to suppress the activity of immune cells such as monocytes, demonstrating significant potential in treating conditions like relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, lymphoma, and other autoimmune diseases.\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cspan lang=\"EN-US\" dir=\"ltr\">CM313 is capable of directly inducing apoptosis in tumor cells and indirectly killing them through mechanisms such as Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC), Complement-Dependent Cytotoxicity (CDC), and Antibody-Dependent Cellular Phagocytosis (ADCP). Preclinical studies have shown that CM313 exhibits a therapeutic response rate of up to 95% in adult patients with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and has displayed favorable safety profiles. These results indicate that CM313 could be an effective treatment option, particularly for patients who are unresponsive or intolerant to conventional therapies.

This drug is a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the critical TSLP, which functions by inhibiting the TSLP-mediated signaling pathways through blocking the interaction between TSLP and its receptor. TSLP is a cytokine playing a crucial role in the development and progression of various immunological diseases, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). When TSLP binds to its receptor, it initiates a series of complex downstream signaling cascades involving significant mechanisms such as the JAK-STAT pathway, thereby promoting inflammatory responses. Binding of TSLP to the complex of TSLP receptor (TSLPR) and IL-7Rα activates antigen-presenting cells and promotes the differentiation of naive CD4+ T lymphocytes into Th2 cells, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Excessive activation of this Th2-type immune response is a key driver of many allergic diseases, such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, and certain autoimmune diseases. In patients with allergic asthma, elevated TSLP levels produced by airway epithelial cells are significantly related to disease severity and decreased lung function. By inhibiting TSLP, SKB378/HBM9378 effectively blocks upstream inflammatory mediators, reduces the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, alleviates airway inflammation and allergic reactions, and improves patient symptoms and lung function.\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cspan style=\"color:black;\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://synapse-static.patsnap.com/strapi-static/image_9e3b0b0d63.png\" alt=\"figure 1\">\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align:center;\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:#2C2C36;\">\u003Cspan lang=\"EN-US\" dir=\"ltr\">Functions of TSLP in promoting type 2 responses\u003Csup>3\u003C/sup>\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cspan lang=\"EN-US\" dir=\"ltr\">As a novel recombinant fully human monoclonal antibody, SKB378/HBM9378 not only exhibits high specificity and potent biological activity but has also been engineered to have an extended half-life, meaning that patients may require fewer dosing sessions to maintain therapeutic efficacy.

The collaboration centers around Simcere Zaiming's independently developed tri-specific antibody, SIM0500, which is currently in Phase I clinical studies in both China and the United States and has been granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). As a humanized tri-specific antibody targeting multiple myeloma (MM), SIM0500 uniquely targets G Protein-Coupled Receptor Class C Group 5 Member D (GPRC5D), B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), and the CD3 molecule on T-cell surfaces. This multi-target approach enhances the selectivity and potency against tumor cells while improving treatment safety and efficacy.\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align:center;\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:black;\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://synapse-static.patsnap.com/strapi-static/image_42f9fcb687.png\" alt=\"figure 2\">\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align:center;\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:#2C2C36;\">\u003Cspan lang=\"EN-US\" dir=\"ltr\">Location and structure of GPRC5D\u003Csup>4\u003C/sup>\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cspan lang=\"EN-US\" dir=\"ltr\">SIM0500 features a low-affinity but highly target-specific CD3 antibody, which helps to avoid severe side effects such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) often associated with traditional bispecific antibodies. Additionally, SIM0500 can recognize and bind to the highly expressed antigens GPRC5D and BCMA on malignant plasma cells, precisely directing the patient's immune system, especially T-cells, to attack the tumor cells. In preclinical studies, SIM0500 exhibited significant antitumor effects, good tolerability, lower effective doses, and sustained response after discontinuation, indicating its potential to be a leading candidate amongst treatments for multiple myeloma. These characteristics position SIM0500 to potentially overcome resistance issues with existing therapies, providing a novel and more effective treatment option for patients.\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cspan lang=\"EN-US\" dir=\"ltr\">From a commercial perspective, this partnership represents a significant milestone for Simcere Zaiming.

Additionally, Simcere Zaiming will receive tiered royalties on net sales of the product outside of the Greater China area. This not only offers direct financial returns but also the opportunity to share in the global market success of SIM0500. AbbVie, in turn, will receive tiered royalties on net sales in the Greater China area. This collaborative model not only accelerates the development of SIM0500 but also reflects the high recognition and support of multinational pharmaceutical companies for innovative Chinese pharmaceutical enterprises.\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cspan lang=\"EN-US\" dir=\"ltr\">\u003Cstrong>5.Bispecific Antibody ICP-B02 (CM355): InnoCare Pharma Partners with Keymed Biomedical to Forge New Frontiers in Cancer Immunotherapy\u003C/strong>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cspan lang=\"EN-US\" dir=\"ltr\">On January 20, 2025, InnoCare Pharma and Keymed Biomedical jointly announced a significant collaboration involving a licensing agreement with Prolium Bioscience to develop and commercialize a bispecific antibody named ICP-B02 (CM355). ICP-B02 is an innovative therapeutic that can simultaneously recognize and bind to CD20 positive target cells and CD3 positive T cells. CD20 is an antigen predominantly found on the surface of B-cell lymphomas, while CD3 is a signature molecule on T cells, involved in the activation of these cells. This dual-targeting mechanism not only directs the immune system's T cells to the tumor cells but also activates them to enhance their ability to effectively kill cancer cells through a process known as T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity (TDCC).\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align:center;\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:black;\">\u003Cimg src=\"https://synapse-static.patsnap.com/strapi-static/image_d540de4797.png\" alt=\"图示\n\n描述已自动生成\">\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align:center;\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:#2C2C36;\">\u003Cspan lang=\"EN-US\" dir=\"ltr\">Summary of the known mechanisms of action of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies\u003Csup>5\u003C/sup>\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cspan lang=\"EN-US\" dir=\"ltr\">ICP-B02 exemplifies the modern trend in tumor immunotherapy – utilizing the body's own immune system to fight cancer through direct contact between cells. This physical proximity not only increases the immune system's ability to recognize tumor cells but also triggers a series of complex signal transduction events through crosslinking the T Cell Receptor (TCR) and CD3 complex. Initially, the CD3 molecules on the surface of T cells are activated under the multivalent cross-linking mediated by ICP-B02, leading to phosphorylation of intracellular motifs in the TCR/CD3 complex, thereby initiating downstream signaling pathways. These signals generally involve the activation of a series of kinases, including Lck and ZAP-70, which collectively enhance T-cell activity. Further, the activation of T cells induced by ICP-B02 is also accompanied by the activation of various effector functions, such as the release of cytokines and cytotoxic granules. In particular, T cells can secrete perforin and granzymes, which can penetrate the membranes of tumor cells and initiate programmed cell death. Moreover, ICP-B02 also promotes T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity (TDCC), where through direct cell-to-cell contact, T cells can effectively destroy neighboring tumor cells. Additionally, ICP-B02 has been optimized to reduce potential toxicity to normal tissues while enhancing therapeutic efficacy. Currently, ICP-B02 is undergoing Phase I/II clinical trials in China, primarily targeting patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), including follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Preliminary results have demonstrated that ICP-B02, whether administered intravenously or subcutaneously, has shown good safety and significant antitumor activity in patients with these types of lymphoma.\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cspan lang=\"EN-US\" dir=\"ltr\">This partnership brings significant economic value and development opportunities to InnoCare Pharma and Keymed Biomedical. According to the agreement, both companies will receive up to $520 million in total payments, including upfront payments, near-term payments, and additional payments upon reaching certain clinical development, registration, and commercialization milestones. Additionally, they will hold a minority stake in Prolium Bioscience and are entitled to receive tiered royalties on net sales of future products. Notably, Prolium has acquired the rights for development, registration, production, and commercialization in the global non-oncology domain and outside Asia in oncology. This deal not only reflects the international pharmaceutical industry's recognition of ICP-B02's potential but also signifies a solid step forward for InnoCare Pharma and Keymed Biomedical in expanding into the global market.\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cspan lang=\"EN-US\" dir=\"ltr\">\u003Cstrong>Summary\u003C/strong>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cspan lang=\"EN-US\" dir=\"ltr\">In review, examining the antibody drug collaborations in January 2025, we can see that Chinese pharmaceutical enterprises are focusing their research on highly expressed and critically important targets for both hematologic malignancies and respiratory diseases such as BCMA, CD20, CD19, and TSLP. These targets are not only significant for diagnosing diseases but are also crucial for developing precision treatment strategies. Therefore, the antibody design and clinical trials centered around these targets often achieve notable therapeutic effects, bringing new hope for cure to patients.&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cspan lang=\"EN-US\" dir=\"ltr\">However, while pursuing innovation, balancing efficacy and safety remains a significant challenge for all researchers. For instance, although SIM0500 was designed to minimize the risk of side effects, continuous monitoring and evaluation are still required in its application. Considering the complexity and diversity of different indications, each novel antibody requires rigorous clinical validation to ensure its safety and efficacy, which is crucial for improving the overall quality of the medication and its competitive position in the market.\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cspan lang=\"EN-US\" dir=\"ltr\">\u003Cstrong>How to get the latest progress on drug deals?\u003C/strong>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cspan lang=\"EN-US\" dir=\"ltr\">If you would like to access the latest transaction event information, you can click on the 'Deal' module from the homepage of the Synapse database.
